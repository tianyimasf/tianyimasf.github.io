# Alex's world of fun coding projects.


## Welcome!

Hello there! I'm Tianyi Ma, I go by Alex. I'm full of ideas and love to spend my spare time doing fun side coding projects. You can find them here. 

Don't be fooled by how I call them -- they are fun side projects but they also help me practice a wide range of skills: from exploratory data analysis, to data visualization, to predictive machine learning, image processing, web dev, ... It's a whole new world out there and they always keep me learning! Even they are fun projects, they are by no means useless.

Here is a list of projects I've worked on and am currently building.
