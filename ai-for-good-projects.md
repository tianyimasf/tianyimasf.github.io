### Video Game Sales Analysis And Modeling Using R

Paper section in the end of the notebook.

Exploratory data analysis for regional sales and categorical variables. Mult-linear regression modeling followed by feature reduction, model statistical robustness diagnosis, model improvement using spline smoothing and GAM, two-part prediction and performance evaluation using confusion matrix, precision/recall/f1 and MSE.
